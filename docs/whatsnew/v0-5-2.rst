v0.5.2 (????)
-------------

API changes
###########

* New bool attribute `use_remaining_value` of `oemof.solph.EnergySystem`
* New method `fix_investments` of `oemof.solph.Model`

New features
############

* Allow for evaluating differences in the remaining vs. the original value
  for multi-period investments.
* Allow to define minimum up- and down-time per time step
* Allow for fixing investment variables to the values of a previous
  optimization run, enabling a repeated solve with fixed investments.

Bug fixes
#########

* Fix handling of investment annuities and fixed costs for multi-period models:
  Limit to costs that occur within the optimization horizon to prevent a
  bias towards investments happening earlier in the optimization horizon.
* Fix bugs in multi-period documentation.
* Fix y intersect of OffsetConverter
* Fix minimum uptime being relevant for initial downtime (and vice versa).
* Fix duplicated discounting of fixed costs for multi-period investment

Testing

Other changes
